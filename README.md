Create directory Data in the same folder as script.

Copy to that folder the Localization.csv, NameIdMapping.json, and Configuration.json files.

When you open it'll ask for the directory to use for VBs, drag and drop should fill it in for you.
Just make sure there's no quotation marks. It will give you the option to save this for later
convenience.

No 3rd party packages required.

vb_manager.py is the program, vb_functions is just helper code (especially if I want to make a
different interface later)
